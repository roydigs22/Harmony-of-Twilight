<header style="font-size: 36;">Welcome to the Harmony of Twilight character generator!</header>
<p>Harmony of Twilight is a TTRPG system that goes from Levels 1 to 10. Now, getting into a new TTRPG (Tabletop Roleplaying Game) can be a daunting task. But not this time. With the help of this generator, you can have a Level 1 character put together in <strong>less than 10 minutes!</strong> Let's get started.</p>
  
  
  <header style="font-size: 26;">First, let's assign your character's stats.</header> 
  <p>These are general measures of a character's raw talent in a given area. Your stats will range from 1-4 when making a character, with 2 considered the average for most ordinary beings. When you create your character, you'll be able to manually assign each one using the dropdown below. Bear in mind that the game was designed around players starting with <strong>a total of 15</strong> in their Stats.</p>
<p>Power: Your ability to exert sheer force upon others. Very important for those bearing heavy armor and weapons.</p>  
  <select>  
  <option>1</option>
  <option>2</option>
  <option>3</option>
  <option>4</option> 
 </select>
<p>Endurance: Your ability to take damage and keep on fighting. Fairly important for all characters.</p>
 <select>

  <option>4</option> 
 </select>
 <p>Agility: Your natural deftness and coordination. Very important for users of light weaponry and armor.

  <option>2</option>
  <option>3</option>
  <option>4</option> 
 </select>
  <p>Spirit: Attunement to and awareness of the world around you. Very important for archers and certain spellcasters</p>

  <option>3</option>
  <option>4</option> 
 </select>
  <header style="font-size: 26;padding-top: 14;">Next, let's choose your race.</header>
  <p>There are many wondrous races available to play in Harmony of Twilight, but we'll keep the selection small to keep things simple. Each Race, while highlighted, will have a short summary pop up below the dropdown giving you a brief description of what they're like.</p>
  <select id="Species">
    <option> </option>
    <option value="human">Human</option>
    <option value="elf">Elf</option>
    <option value="dwarf">Dwarf</option> 
    <option value="titan">Titanid</option>
    <option value="snake">Viperkin</option>
    <option value="derg">Dramael</option>
  </select>
    <section id="humanSummary" class="speciesSummary hidden">
    <p>Humans can be found in all corners of the world, from the snowy wastes of Arcetis to the far eastern hills of Irua and even the cold forests of Lochiun and the burning sands of Drakna. Short though their lives may be, and in spite of lacking any remarkable physical features, humans are defined in large part by their determined natures and the strength they display when they finally stop bickering over petty things. If a human says they will see something done, believe them.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="elfSummary" class="speciesSummary hidden">
    <p>Elves. Flighty, Free-spirited, and just a little haughty. With lives that span 250 to 260 years, some would consider Elves living history lessons... if you can convince them to teach you. Most elves will be found in the western forests of Murau and Lochiun, though it's not uncommon to see them travelling most anywhere. Outside of the forests in the west, most elves settle down around Kateris and Delthos, where fine crafts abound.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="dwarfSummary" class="speciesSummary hidden">
    <p>Short, stout, and sturdy. Dwarves are a merry and industrious folk, filling their days with all manner of productivity... and their bellies with a fair amout of ale and mead. Their busy nature grants them a long life of just over two centuries, which would provide them almost the same perspective as elves if they ever chose to travel. It's extremely uncommon to see dwarves outside of the mountains of Obsias, though the scant few that choose to leave usually settle in Irua, Delthos, or Kateris.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="titanSummary" class="speciesSummary hidden">
    <p>The world itself may sound as though it trembles when a Titanid is moved to anger. Distant descendants of the giant clans, these mighty men tower over their contemporaries, and often remain just as aloof for their century-and-a-half lifespans as their sheer size would have you believe. In spite of that, they do have an appreciation for many finer things, as titanids are the only people who've spread across the continent anywhere near as much as humans in spite of their much smaller population.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="snakeSummary" class="speciesSummary hidden">
    <p>Viperkin. Seldom seen outside of the miserable jungles of Theamai and rumored sightings in Draknan deserts, the serpent people are perhaps the most fearsome of all. The only common thing that links them is a humanoid torso and the tail of a serpent, but beyond that could be anything from wicked venomous fangs to hair that grows in the same manner as a cobra's hood. Viperkin live and die by the hunt, and so rarely live to see half of a century, though ones that choose a more peaceful live can live to be 80.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="dergSummary" class="speciesSummary hidden">
    <p>Dramael. They seem to be relatives of the Elves, though most of either that you ask would deny the thought and grow angry at the idea. Dramael would seem to be elves at a quick and uncaring glance, but a closer inspection reveals their true nature; clothing adjusted to accomodate for a hidden set of wings; a gauntlet of metallic scales that lead up their arms. Descended of the king of dragons, Dramael are almost never seen outside of Drakna, Kateris, and Irua. They've been observed with strong loyalty to tribe and family, and what few notes have been made about them estimate their lives to be about 120-130 years.</p>
    </section>
  <header style="font-size: 26;padding-top: 14;">With your race chosen, now you'll choose your racial feats!</header>
  <p>Harmony of Twilight is a system based on modularity and choices, and this will be your first introduction to what that means. Each race has a selection of Feats available exclusively to them, and you get to pick 3 when making a character!</p>
